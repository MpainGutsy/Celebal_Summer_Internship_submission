## ✅ Key Activities

### 1. ⚙️ Advanced DAX & Measures

Created and optimized several new measures using advanced DAX techniques:

- Time-based metrics:  
  - `Sales YTD`, `Sales MTD`, `Sales Last Year`, `YoY Growth %`
- Ranking and segmentation:  
  - `Top 5 Products`, `Customer Ranking`, `Profit Quartile`
- Conditional metrics:  
  - Dynamic status labels, profitability buckets, and KPI indicators

### 2. 🕵️‍♂️ Deeper Data Insights

Performed multi-dimensional analysis to answer deeper business questions:

- **Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison**
- **Customer Retention vs Acquisition**
- **Sales Funnel Performance**
- **High-performing vs Low-performing Campaigns**
- **Product Profitability vs Volume Sold**

### 3. 🧩 UX Enhancements & Interactive Features

Implemented Power BI features to improve interactivity:

- **Drillthrough Pages**  
  - Allows users to click into detailed customer or product profiles
- **Tooltips**  
  - Custom tooltips for hovering over visuals with extra context
- **Bookmarks & Selection Panes**  
  - Created navigation controls, page views, and dynamic filtering
- **Dynamic Titles & Labels**  
  - Visuals change based on slicer or filter selection
- **Sync Slicers Across Pages**

### 4. 🚀 Performance Optimization

Improved report speed and model efficiency:

- Removed unused columns & tables
- Reduced cardinality of high-cardinality fields
- Used **measures instead of calculated columns** where applicable
- Replaced repeated `IF` statements with `SWITCH` for cleaner DAX
- Implemented **summary tables** to reduce real-time aggregation

### 5. 📊 Visual Improvements

Enhanced clarity, consistency, and storytelling in visual reports:

- Aligned KPIs, consistent color schemes and titles
- Added data labels, annotations, and explanatory text boxes
- Used conditional formatting to highlight critical metrics
- Responsive layout across devices (desktop/tablet)
