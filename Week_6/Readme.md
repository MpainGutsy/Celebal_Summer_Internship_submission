# üìÅ Week 6 Submission ‚Äì Power BI Project

## üìå Overview

Week 6 was dedicated to advancing the analytical capabilities of the Power BI dashboard using **complex DAX functions**, **scenario analysis**, and **dynamic reporting** techniques. The goal was to deepen insights, make reports more adaptable, and prepare for long-term analytical use cases.

## ‚úÖ Key Activities

### 1. üß† Advanced DAX Implementation

- Implemented 15+ intermediate and advanced **DAX measures**, including:
  - `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, `ALL`, `ALLSELECTED`, `VALUES`
  - Time intelligence functions like `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`, `PARALLELPERIOD`, `DATESYTD`
  - Conditional logic using `SWITCH`, `IF`, and `SELECTEDVALUE`
- Developed **dynamic titles**, **custom tooltips**, and **trend lines** using DAX
- Created KPIs for:
  - Month-over-month and Year-over-year comparisons
  - Segment-wise growth trends
  - Retention and drop-off metrics

### 2. üïí Date & Time Functions

- Utilized 5+ datetime-related DAX functions to support period-based filtering:
  - `DATEADD`, `TODAY`, `NOW`, `DATEDIFF`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`
- Built a **calendar table** for use in time intelligence
- Enabled features such as:
  - Dynamic comparison across time periods
  - Rolling 12-month analysis
  - Custom fiscal year logic

### 3. üìä Scenario Analysis & What-If Parameters

- Created **What-If parameters** to simulate changes in pricing, cost, or demand
- Used parameter selections to visualize impact on profit margins and revenue
- Enabled users to **interactively model different business scenarios**

### 4. üìå Enhanced Visualizations

- Applied **advanced visuals** like:
  - Decomposition Tree for factor breakdown
  - Matrix with conditional formatting
  - Custom tooltips and drilldowns for deep insights
- Ensured all visuals remained performant and insightful under filters

### 5. üîç User-Focused Interactivity

- Improved navigation with synced slicers, multi-page bookmarks, and button actions
- Used `SELECTEDVALUE()` to dynamically adjust metric labels, visuals, and outputs
- Made the report adaptable based on user role or selected department
