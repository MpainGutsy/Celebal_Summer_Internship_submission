## 📌 Final Thoughts

Power BI gives you flexible options whether you're analyzing your own data or delivering dashboards across an organization. If you just need basic reporting, Pro might be enough. But if you're working with big data models, need more refreshes, or want pixel-perfect reports—Premium is the way to go.
